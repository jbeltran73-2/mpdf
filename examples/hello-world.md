# Hello, MPDF!

This is a minimal MPDF document. It demonstrates that the compiler can process simple Markdown and produce a valid `.mpdf` file.

## What is MPDF?

MPDF is an open document format designed for both human readability and AI ingestion. Documents are packaged as ZIP containers with Markdown source, CSS styling, and embedded fonts.

> The future of documents is structured text, not rasterized pages.

## Code Example

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello from MPDF!";
console.log(greeting);
```

That's it. Simple and clean.
